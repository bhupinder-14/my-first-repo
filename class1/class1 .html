<!--                            CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
                    It is used for the -
                    - appearance
                    - styling
                    - formatting
                    of a webpage.


        What is a Selector?
            It is a way in which we can select one (or more) element (or elements)
            An example fo a selector (we have used it many times before):-
                        table {
                            color: aqua;
                        }
            here table was the selector, color was a property and aqua was the value.
            
        Types of Selectors?
            1. Simple Selectors:
                    Element Selector - (Tag Selector)
                                        We directly use the name of the element or the name of the tag used
                                        to specify the styling that we need to perform on it
                                        Like for example- When we use table, p {
                                                                        }
                                        For tables and paragraphs instead of taking their names
                                        and just use their element tag itself.

                    Class Selector - A class can be assigned to a group of different elements and similar styling
                                    can be assigned to the same group of elements.
                                    Keep in mind that whenever we need to access a Class we need to use a
                                    period (.) before its name to access it.

                    ID Selector - ID is unique. When we need to individually style any ONE element or a tag
                                    then we assign it a particular ID and then style that ID with CSS.
                                    We cannot assign one ID to another element it is always unique.
                                    Keep in mind that whenever we need to access an ID we need to use a
                                    hashtag (#) before its name to access it.
            2. Pseudo-classes Selector:
                                    Pseudo Class is a keyword that displays the special state of your tag.
                                    It is a keyword using which we can show a special state of a tag.
                                    For example- checkout the button hover thing from above.
                                    We can use this alongside a class selector as well as ID selector.
            3. Multiple Selector:
                                    When we use more than one tag while applying styling the situation
                                    is known as using Multiple Selectors.
                                    Like for example- When we used table, tr, td, th { } while styling
                                    during our tables class.
