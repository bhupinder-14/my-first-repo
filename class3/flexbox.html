<!--                                 FlexBox
            It is a 1 Dimensional layout model through which we can perform
            - Space distribution
            - Alignment capabilities
            It is like a container (and we call it flexbox)
            There exists a parent-child relationship here.
            The parents name is - flex
            Then the immediate nested elements inside the flex, the childs,
            are called it's flex items.
            The horizontal axis is known as main axis
            The vertical axis is known as cross axis
            Simply put:
                    It is a layout model using which we can handle the alignment
                    of many elements easily.

            Steps on how to make it a flex:
            - We need to write
                            display: flex;
             in the css of the container (the parent box)




                                Flex-container Properties:
            Flex container becomes flexible by setting the display property to flex
            - Flex-direction: row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse
            - Flex-wrap: wrap, nowrap, wrap-reverse
            - Flex-flow: shorthand notation for the two above properties.
            - Justify-content: It aligns the items above the main-axis
            - Align-items
            - Align-content



            align-items?
                        aligns the content according to the cross-axis (vertical axis)
            
            align-content?
                        it handles the spacing between the rows of the flex-items.





                                Flex-items Properties:
            The child elements inside the flexbox become flexible (flex) items
            Idhar hamlog child items ke upar formatting apply karenge....
            abhi tak parent box ke upar apply kar rahe the
            - Order: When we have to change the orders of the boxes (like from start to end)
            - Flex-grow (shown in CSS)
            - Flex-shrink (shown in CSS)
            - Flex-basis (explained well below in NOTE)
            - Flex (it is a shorthand notation by which we can use the above 4 properties in a single line)
            - Align-self (Only one item is aligned)


        NOTE- FLEX makes your website responsive. It will respond to the changes that it earlier did not respond to.
              For example- Using width and flex-baasis seems to do the same thing? right?
                           NO bcoz when we use width and we put too much content then that content gets cut
                           and only a little part is shown, whereas when we use the flex-basis then in that case the
                           excess content is still put up in the box and more room is made for the extra content.
                           THAT shows that the website has become responsive now.






                                PARALLAX Effect
        Objects moving with different speeds in the same frame (due to the distance between them and the distance between them and you)
        is known as the Parallax Effect. It takes place between a background image and a foreground image such that whenever we scroll them
        we observe parallax.
