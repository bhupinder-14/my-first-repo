<!--                    Relative Positioning
            When the element is positioned relative to its original position

                        Fixed Positioning
            An element with this positioning will not move and will stay at
            the same place even if the page is scrolled.

                        Absolute Positioning
            The element will be positioned based on the relative position of
            uts ancestor (or its parent element) and it positions according
            to the parents dimensions.
            Only happens when the parent body's position is set as NON STATIC.

                        Sticky Positioning
            It toggles between relative and fixed depending on the scroll position.
